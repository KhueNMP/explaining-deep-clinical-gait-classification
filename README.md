## Code, Data and Reproducibility

### Figures
Folder `figures` contains code and data for (generating) the overview figure shown in the paper.


### Model Training, Evaluation and XAI Attributions
Folder `python` contains code for model training and evaluation, based on python3 and the python sub-package of the [LRP Toolbox (version 1.3.0rc2)](https://github.com/sebastian-lapuschkin/lrp_toolbox). Should you use or extend the implementation in the present repository, please consider citing the toolbox, as well as our paper mentioned above.

}
```

In folder `python`, the file `install.sh` contains instructions to setup [`Miniconda3`](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)-based virtual environments for python, as required by our code.
Option A only considers CPU hardware, while option B enables GPU support
for neural network training and evaluation. Comment/uncomment the lines appropriately.

All recorded gait data used in the paper is available in folder `python/data`.
Training- and evaluation scripts for fully reproducing the data splits, models and prediction explanations are
provided with files `python/gait_experiments_batch*.py`.
The folder `sge` contains files `*.args`, presenting the mentioned training-evaluation runs as (probably more) handy command line parameters, one per line, either to be called directly as
```
python gait_experiments.py ${ARGS_LINE}
```
or to be submitted to a SUN Grid Engine with
```
python sge_job_simple.py your_file_of_choice.args
```
Some paths and variables need to be adjusted.

### Dataset-wide Analyses of XAI
The Meta-Analysis of relevance attributions using Spectral Relevance Analysis (SpRAy) are based on implementations from the [CoRelAy](https://github.com/virelay/corelay) framework.
Should you use or extend the implementation in the present repository, please consider citing the software paper, as well as our paper mentioned at the top of this page.

```

In folder `python`, the file `install_metaanalysis.sh` contains the requirements to use the [CoRelAy](https://github.com/virelay/corelay) package implementing SpRAy.

All data analyzed with SpRAy in our manuscript is provided in `python/data_metaanalysis`. Various analyses can be configured and executed using
```
python main_metaanalysis.py ${ARGS}
```
Provide `--help` as part of the `${ARGS}` for an overview of the parameterization options. Run (and adapt as documented) the file `run_metaanalysis.sh` to replicate our results from the manuscript.
